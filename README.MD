Welcome to the repository of the Hometown Homepage solo project.
This was created as part of the introduction course for CYF, using the skills I acquired by following the tutorials on Scrimba in the Learn HTML and CSS course.

This project was made entirely in HTML and CSS, it is my first solo project as well.
